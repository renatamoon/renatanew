Just for the note ...

This is my new project of the SELENIUM. JFY information," SELENIUM is a portable framework for testing web applications. Selenium provides a playback tool for authoring functional tests without the need to learn a test scripting  language".

What I did in my test with Selenium, was using the Python language, to:

1. open a Chrome web browser page
2. impor the python libraries of "web driver", "Keys" and "By"
3. include a command to start the search on the google chrome. Find the element of XPATH. I did it doing an inspect on the HTML basis o Google Chrome;
4. Then I did another search and using the "send keys" to imput the "Bolsas de Mulher" on the search bar, then using Keys and .click to click on the ID "TADS" to click on what I project it to click. The ENTER is to enter the search. Concluding. 

This coding process was just on the first projects I am able to finish for myself. I hope you appreciate it.
